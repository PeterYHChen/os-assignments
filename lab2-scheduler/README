In lab 2, I use C++ to implement the scheduler.

<lab2-scheduler.cpp> is my source code file of lab 2, while <test.in> is an plain text input file where you can put input data inside.
<a.out> is a default output file generated by g++ compilation command.

To compile:
    g++ lab2-scheduler.cpp

To run:
    ./a.out --verbose test.in

To run with verbose flag:
    ./a.out --verbose test.in

IMPORTANT NOTES!!!
1. Please make sure the <random-numbers> file is under the same directory as my source code.
2. "./a.out" only accepts two arguments or less as above.
3. If problems happen, please make sure <a.out>, <random-numbers>, and <test.in> are in the same directory.
4. In <test.in> file for input data, only one process mix is accepted, multiple process mixes in <test.in> file will cause unexpected error.

FOR YOUR TESTING!!!
After running with the command above, 4 options of algorithms are provided. You can input 1, 2, 3, or 4 to select one algorithm to run on the current process mix data.

--------------------------------------------------------------
Please select a scheduling algorithm for simulation:
1. FCFS    2. RR with quantum 2    3. Uniprogrammed    4. SJF
