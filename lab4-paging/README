In lab 4, I use C++ to implement the paging.

<lab4-paging.cpp> is my source code file of lab 4, while <a.out> is a default output file generated by g++ compilation command.

To compile:
    g++ lab4-paging.cpp

To run:
    ./a.out N P S J N R

IMPORTANT NOTES!!!
1. Please make sure the <random-numbers> file is under the same directory as my source code.
2. "./a.out" only accepts exactly six arguments as above.
3. If problems happen, please make sure <a.out> and <random-numbers> are in the same directory.
