In lab 3, I use C++ to implement the banker.

<lab3-banker.cpp> is my source code file of lab 3, while <test.in> is an plain text input file where you can put input data inside.
<a.out> is a default output file generated by g++ compilation command.

To compile:
    g++ lab3-banker.cpp

To run:
    ./a.out test.in

IMPORTANT NOTES!!!
1. If problems happen, please make sure <a.out> and <test.in> are in the same directory.
